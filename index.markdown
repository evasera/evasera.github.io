I am a videogames programmer, recently graduated from my specialization at the School of Art and Technology (ESAT) in Valencia, where I developed 
[Sun Warriors](/portfolio/sun_warriors)

I have always been an enthusiast of videogames and computers, which is why I 
decided to study computer science. I obtained a BSc in Computer Science at the UPV. I spent a year at Reykjavik University, where I had the oportunity to take subjects related to videogames. That reignited my passion on videogames development, and once I came back, I chose to make a final project related to videogames. [Unity Weather System](/portfolio/weather_system).

I decided that I wanted to deepen my knoledge on videogames development, so I enrolled in ESAT's HNd in Videogames Programmimg. 

From all the things IÂ´ve studied, I love working on gameplay and ai the most.
