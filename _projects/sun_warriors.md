# About the Game
Aysel, Godess of the Moon, after years of being relegated to the shadows of her brother Naol, God of the Sun, decides to take revenge and invide the earth and destroy the humans, her brother's favorite creation. 

During a terrible solar eclipse, Aysel opens multiple portals pouring thousands of her terrible creations. Naol, using the last of his strength will bestow special powers to four chosen champions, so they can stop Aysel.
