## About the Game

Aysel, Goddess of the Moon, after years of being relegated to the shadows of her brother Naol, God of the Sun, decides to take revenge and invade the earth and destroy the humans, her brother's favorite creation.

During a terrible solar eclipse, Aysel opens multiple portals pouring thousands of her terrible creations. Naol, using the last of his strength will bestow special powers to four chosen champions, so they can stop Aysel.

Players will have to team up in this frenetic top-down arcade game, either locally or online.

- Platform: Windows 
- Engine/Languages: Unreal Engine 4 (C++ and Blueprints)
- Duration: 10 months

## My work contribution  
{: style="text-align: justify" }
My biggest contribution to the project was as part of the team in charge of researching and implementing Unreal Engine replication, adapting our game into an online Multiplayer game. As this involved changing the rest of the team's work, I gained a basic understanding of how most of the game elements were implemented, this meant that whenever there was help or small tasks that were needed I was in an ideal position to help out.

Other than replication, my two biggest contributions to the project were the implementation of the enemy spawners, both as spawning predefined waves and an infinite spawner with increasing difficulty for the arena mode, and all of the level scripting for the narrative maps, including narrative, puzzles, level streaming, and several interactable elements.
