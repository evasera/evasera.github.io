## About the Game  ##

{: style="text-align: justify" }
Tower Smash is a simple Tower Defense game for android devices developed as a student project at ESAT Valencia. 

The game has two modes, a classic history mode where the player will play through a progressively difficult selection of levels, and an endless mode where the player will be challenged to survive as many enemy waves as possible.


## Details ##

{: style="text-align: justify" }
This game was developed by a team of four videogames programming students.

- Platform: Android 
- Engine/Languages: Unity 3D
- Duration: 5 months

## My work contribution  ##

{: style="text-align: justify" }
For this project, I was in charge of creating the towers and their behavior, from combat and a simple AI to the animations or particle effects.



Thank you for your time and consideration.
